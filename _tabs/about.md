I am an offensive security professional, which means that I make a living out of hacking companies. 

However, it's a little bit more complex than that. What I really do is to help companies to stregthen their cybersecurity program with an unique perspective: I add technical and offensive knowledge to my information security and IT background so I can better provide advice and recommendations to clients. My ultimate goal is to give insight where others fail to see potential problems.
